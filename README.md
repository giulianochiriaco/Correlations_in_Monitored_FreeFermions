Code for calculating the behavior of quantum correlations (as function of time and distance) in noisy free fermion systems.
job_Cr.sh is the launch script (at the moment optimized to run on the CINECA cluster)
FF_TransientCr.py is the function that runs the simulations for different quantum trajectories and values of p1 and saves the results to file
Free_Fermions_Functions.py is the file with all the functions used in the simulation
